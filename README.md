# Alpha Centauri KBD

This is a custom keyboard/keymap that is specifically taylored to my hands and workflow style. It takes heavy inspiration from [crkbd v3](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd). The primary difference is the vertical spacing of the keys, and I have also removed one key from the outside column. I also have roadmap plans for adding multiple encoders, and a custom OLED display.

The keymap has been designed for comfort and efficiency, prioritizing typing/programming over other activities such as gaming.
